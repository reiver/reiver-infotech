§ e-mail

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**E-Mail** is a messaging system and application generally used for communication between people — that is (indirectly) inspired by //mail// and //post-office system//.

**E-Mail** is a copy of [[netmail]] from the **bulletin board system** (**BBS**) computer networks.

**E-Mail** is one of the most popular applications on the Internet.

**E-Mail** is an early (online) social-network on the Internet and is still in heavy use today.

§§ Webmail

Since the late 1990s and early 2000s there was a transition of people, who used **e-mail**, to use **e-mail client** with [[world-wide-web]] based front-end [[user-interface]]s — called **webmail**.

While still very popular, **webmail** has declined a bit, as **e-mail** applications (without [[world-wide-web]] based front-end [[user-interface]]s) for mobile-phones have also become popular.
