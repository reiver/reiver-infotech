§ dmoz

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**dmoz**, also known as the **Open Directory Project** or **ODP**, is an open content hierarchical web directory (similar to **Yahoo!**).

§§ Names And Domains

**dmoz** was originally called: **Gnuhoo**.
But because of a [[flame-war]] mostly over at [[slashdot]], the name was later changed to **Newhoo**.

When [[netscape]] bought it, it was then renamed the **Open Directory Project**, and given the domain ``directory.mozilla.org``.
This domain was then shortened to ``dmoz.org``, which is where the current name comes from.

§§ Editors

From about the 1997 to the year 2000, I was an editor at **dmoz**, and went by the handle (nickname) **tnt**.
While I was an editor at the **Open Directory Project**, work I did included:

• the creation of new content,
• approving of (or disapproving of) submutted content, and
• searching for new content.

Back when I was a editor dmoz, dmoz editors largely communicated via private forums.

The dmoz editors were organized into a class-system; where some editors were more equal than others.

§§ Smilies

One thing that I find amusing is that there is a custom //smiley// named after me in the (private) dmoz forums.
And in particular, name my handle (nickname).

The //code// for the custom //smiley// is —

And dmoz forum software would swap that code for this image:

I also created the images for a couple of custom //smilies//.

§§ Inside Jokes

Other things I feel somewhat nostalgic towards are: **YKYATODPW** and the **Canadian Sekrit Forces**.

They are both inside jokes known to certain ODP editors at the time.

(**YKYATODPW** was an abbreviation for **"You Know You Are Addicted To ODP When**.)
