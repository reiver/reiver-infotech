§ Twitter

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

Twitter is a micro-blogging site found at: http:/((/))twitter.com/

I first joined Twitter on **March 15th, 2008**, but — had been using Twitter before that.
I was reading content on Twitter back (I think) in 2007, due to other people on the [[videoblogging-mailing-list]] using it.

I initially joined Twitter due to people I knew on the [[videoblogging-mailing-list]] using it.

I also created what was at one time the most popular Twitter-client — [[hootsuite]].

On Twitter, my handle (nickname) is ``@reiver``

For a long time I was a very heavy Twitter user.

Later most of my micro-blogging moved over to the [[fediverse]].
