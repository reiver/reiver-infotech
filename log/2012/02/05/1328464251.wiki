It would be nice if there was a tool that could alert me when new papers or articles are written by authors I've read.

Webfeeds using Atom, hAtom, JSON, RSS, etc would be perfect for it, but not all authors use it unfortunately.

If you look at many paper author's home-pages, hosted at Universities, you get feeling they don't have a good grasp of web technologies.

I wonder if these authors would use software that exposed Atom, hAtom, JSON, RSS, etc, if it were free, open-source, and easy to use.
